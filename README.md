# Acknowledgements

This is not my own project but rather just a testing of another project. This is the link to the original repository: https://github.com/silveryshine/ITN-data-generation. All credits goes to the owner of the repository and anyone he has also credited in his project. 

# Changes
During testing, I have made changes to some part of the project which are highlighted in the file ITN Pipeline Notes.pdf. The bertscorealign.py is also the alternative method I used to do word alignment instead of the Cross-Align method highlighted in the original project.
